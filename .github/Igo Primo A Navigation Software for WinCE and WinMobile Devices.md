Now that you have installed Igo Primo on your device, you might want to learn some tips and tricks to make the most of it. Here are some of them:

- How to change the skin: If you want to customize the appearance of Igo Primo, you can change the skin by editing the sys.txt file. You can find different skins online or create your own. To change the skin, you need to add a line like this in the sys.txt file: [interface] skin="skin\_name". Replace skin\_name with the name of the skin folder that you have downloaded or created.
- How to add custom points of interest (POIs): If you want to add your own POIs, such as campgrounds, restaurants, gas stations and more, you can do so by creating a .txt file with the coordinates and names of the POIs. You can use online tools or GPS software to get the coordinates. Then, you need to place the .txt file in the content/userdata/poi folder and create a .bmp file with the same name as the .txt file for the icon. The icon should be 22x22 pixels and placed in the content/userdata/poi/icon folder. You also need to edit the sys.txt file and add a line like this: [poi] multipoi="poi\_name". Replace poi\_name with the name of the .txt and .bmp files.
- How to update the maps: If you want to update the maps, you need to download the latest map files from a reliable source. You can find some links in the references section below. Then, you need to replace the old map files in the content/map folder with the new ones. You also need to update the license files in the license folder if necessary.

These are some of the tips and tricks that can help you use Igo Primo more efficiently and enjoyably. If you have any questions or problems, you can check online forums or contact customer support for assistance.
