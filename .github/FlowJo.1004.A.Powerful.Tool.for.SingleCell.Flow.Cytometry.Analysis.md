# FlowJo 10.0.4: A Powerful Tool for Single-Cell Flow Cytometry Analysis
 
Flow cytometry is a technique that allows researchers to measure the physical and chemical characteristics of individual cells in a fluid sample. Flow cytometry can be used for various applications, such as immunology, hematology, oncology, and stem cell research.

In this article, we will show you how to use FlowJo 10.0.4 to perform a basic analysis of a flow cytometry data set. The data set we will use is from a study that investigated the expression of CD4 and CD8 markers on T cells in healthy and HIV-infected individuals .
 
The first step is to import the data files into FlowJo 10.0.4. You can do this by clicking on the "Add Samples" button on the toolbar and selecting the files from your computer. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the files from your file explorer into the workspace.
 
Once the files are imported, you will see them listed in the workspace window. You can rename, group, or color-code the files as you wish. You can also view the metadata of each file by clicking on the "i" icon next to the file name.
 
The next step is to create a plot to visualize the data. You can do this by clicking on the "New Plot" button on the toolbar and selecting the type of plot you want to create. For this example, we will create a dot plot with CD4 on the x-axis and CD8 on the y-axis.
 
After creating the plot, you will see it in the layout window. You can adjust the plot settings, such as axes, scales, colors, and labels, by clicking on the "Plot Editor" button on the toolbar.
 
The final step is to create gates to define and quantify the cell populations of interest. You can do this by clicking on the "Gate" button on the toolbar and selecting the shape of the gate you want to draw. For this example, we will draw a rectangular gate around the CD4+CD8- population and name it "T helper".
 
After creating the gate, you will see it in the layout window and in the workspace window. You can modify or delete the gate by right-clicking on it and selecting the appropriate option. You can also create sub-gates or nested gates by drawing gates within existing gates.
 
To view the statistics of each gate, such as count, frequency, mean, median, and standard deviation, you can click on the "Table Editor" button on the toolbar and select the parameters you want to display. You can also export or print the table by clicking on the "File" menu and selecting the appropriate option.
