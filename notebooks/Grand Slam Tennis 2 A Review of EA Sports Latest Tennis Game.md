One of the main innovations of Grand Slam Tennis 2 is the Total Racket Control system, which allows players to control their shots with the right analog stick. By flicking the stick in different directions, players can perform flat, slice, or top-spin shots. The system also applies to serving, volleying, and lobbing. Alternatively, players can use the traditional button-based controls if they prefer. The game also supports PlayStation Move for motion-based gameplay.
 
Grand Slam Tennis 2 has received mixed reviews from critics and players alike. Some praised the game for its realistic graphics, animations, and gameplay, as well as its licensed content and online features. Others criticized the game for its lack of personality, emotion, and challenge, especially in the career mode. Some also reported technical issues, such as long loading times, repetitive commentary, and glitches.

However, many of their releases are fake or infected with malware. Some of them also require users to enter a password to extract the files, which is usually a scam to make them complete surveys or download unwanted software.

Instead, we suggest you buy the original game from a legitimate source or play it on a console if you have one.

Players can also customize their character's appearance, clothing, equipment, and skills. The career mode spans 10 years, during which players can rise from a rookie to a legend. Along the way, players can unlock various rewards, such as new courts, outfits, and racquets.
 
The game also features a classic mode that allows players to relive some of the most memorable matches in tennis history. Players can choose from 25 classic scenarios, such as Federer vs Nadal at Wimbledon 2008, McEnroe vs Borg at Wimbledon 1980, or Williams vs Sharapova at Wimbledon 2004. Each scenario has its own objectives and challenges, such as winning a certain number of games or points, or performing specific shots. Completing the classic mode unlocks more scenarios and legends to play with.
 
For those who want to test their skills against other players, Grand Slam Tennis 2 provides online modes that support up to four players. Players can join or create online tournaments that mimic the real Grand Slam events, or play casual matches with friends or strangers. The game also tracks the players' stats and rankings in the Battle of the Nations leaderboard, which shows the performance of each country based on the results of its players. Additionally, the game supports ESPN integration, which allows players to watch live tennis matches and highlights within the game.
